server-install
==============

Makefile's that are used to create build farm servers.

To get things started you need to execute the following file:
https://raw.github.com/BrianAker/server-install/master/bootstrap.sh

This is a constantly in flux sort of project where I am working out idea and probably trying to learn "stuff". Don't expect it to work for you and until I find a way to emulate Launchpad's branch system on Github the trunk will be filled with commits (the annoying kind).
