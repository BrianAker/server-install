server-install
==============

This is a constantly in flux sort of project where I am working out idea and probably trying to learn "stuff". Don't expect it to work for you and until I find a way to emulate Launchpad's branch system on Github the trunk will be filled with commits (the annoying kind).

If you want to use it you should start by modifying hosts to include your own servers. You can type "make install" from there to get  things moving.

The Makefile is just a wrapper around common ansible commands.
